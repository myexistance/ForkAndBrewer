      With forty beer taps, a top-flight kitchen crew, friendly staff and a brewery on the premises, our mission is to take Wellingtons already awesome beer culture to an entire other level.

      You can find us upstairs at 14 Bond Street in central Wellington.</h4>

	<h4 class="col-sm-10 col-lg-offset-1 text-justify" style = "width: 95%">Wellington's Fork & Brewer brewpub was delighted to announce Kelly Ryan as our new brewer in mid 2014. Ryan is a talented and highly regarded brewer with experience working around New Zealand and the United Kingdom. His beers and ciders have won multiple awards at major beer shows. He's even been called a "bit of a brewing rock star." 

      A big fan of the brewpub concept where beer is made right on the premises, Ryan says he is excited to be making beer in the heart of Wellington, looking forward to producing beers which get customers excited, and pleased to working with people as passionate about craft beer as he is. Despite his youthful good looks, 

      Director Colin Mallon says the Fork & Brewer team are proud to have been able to attract a brewer of Ryan's calibre. "Kelly is an outstanding brewer and we are thrilled to have him on board. He will bring expertise, experience and creativity to our 1,000 litre on-site micro-brewery. An in-house brewery means our beers only travel metres from tank to tap. This is a key feature of the Fork & Brewer as a craft beer.</h4>
